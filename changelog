version 0.5.3
    The loader had to be disabled since postgis' raster python loader is not working with the current trunk.
    Updated the reader to make use of the new raster_columns view.

version 0.5.2
    Fixed bug when reading one row as raster in a database without raster tables.
    The plugin now can upload raster as a standalone program.
    Plugin now guesses good numbers for raster overviews.

version 0.5.1
        Bug fix- Exceptions handling.

version 0.5.0
	Added thread for the loader. Now the user is able to cancel and see messages while loading.
	Added more options for raster loading. Now the plugin can load single row raster data and vector bounding boxes of tiled rasters.
	The "Add PostGIS raster layer" tool now check's for available raster colums and read metadata from raster_columns.
	Layer listing now checks for postgis and pgraster extensions.
	
version 0.4.2
	New options on the loader interface. Now it's able to build overviews.

version 0.4.1
	Minor bugfixes.

version 0.4.0
	Compatibility with PostGIS 2.0 SVN and GDAL 1.8. Many options were revised as GDAL 1.7 doesn't work the same way 1.8 does.

version 0.3.4
    Bugfix for the database menu as recommended by Giuseppe.

version 0.3.3
    Workaround for the transparency bug. Now it forces transparency level to -32768 to avoid problems.

version 0.3.2 
    Bugfixes thanks to Paolo Cavalini
    Finished the migration to psycopg using PGManager's utils.
    Now the user can choose a python script that is dinamically loaded instead of choosing a folder on the Loader GUI.
    The script now doesn't require a postgis installation. gdal2wktraster.py was embedded on the script and should be upgraded from time to time. This way non-server users can load data too with just a plain gdal installation.
version 0.3.1
    bugfixes thanks to Noli Sicad

version 0.3
    Created a new loader interface. The user is now able to load data to postgis using the plugin. 
    Refactoring aiming to be more like other Postgis Plugins and use psycopg as postgis module.

versions 0.2.x
    bugfixes
    The code was prepared for gdal version 1.8 and new stuff Jorge implemented but they are not backwards compatible so these changes are still frozen.

version 0.2
    The plugin now connects to the database using PyQt SQL to read what are the available tables there and shows metadata.

version 0.1
    The plugin loads data using a input box.
